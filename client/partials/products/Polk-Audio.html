                                Polk has carefully crafted the Hampden speakers to deliver superior sound. The teak-veneered MDF enclosures virtually eliminate unwanted vibrations. The speakers sit angled to position the sound field properly when you're seated at your desk. The speaker cable uses 4-pin Euro-style connectors to ensure tight, secure connections for minimal signal loss. Midrange and bass frequencies are handled by a pair of 4-1/2" composite polypropylene cone woofers, while a pair of 1" silk/polymer soft-dome tweeters produce smooth highs. Each driver is powered by its own dedicated amplifier channel: the system uses 30 watts x 2 for the mids and 10 watts x 2 for the tweeters. Sound is clean, detailed, and impactful. Want to enjoy music from your smartphone or tablet? Just pair your device to the Hampden and stream wirelessly via Bluetooth. The system features aptX audio coding, an advanced form of Bluetooth that allows higher-fidelity sound with compatible devices. Hampden is backwards-compatible with earlier forms of Bluetooth, too. The Hampden speakers are ready to rock your party. When you and your friends download the free Polk Audio DJ Stream app from Apple iTunes or Google Play, the fun can start. As host, you can authorize three other friends to stream music to the Hampden. The app builds a playlist, taking each tune in sequence. Everyone with the app will see the playlist of upcoming tracks and get to vote “Thumbs Up” or “Thumbs Down.” You can change DJ assignments around, so everyone has a chance to share their favorite songs. And when the party's over, the vote tally will show you which DJ had the hottest tracks.
